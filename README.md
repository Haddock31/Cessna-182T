# Cessna-182T
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 modification of the Carenado Cessna-182T Skylane G1000

## About
This is a modification of the Cessna-182T Skylane G1000 aircraft created by Carenado for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Currently, this modification adds the normal procedure checklists from the supplied pdf operating manuals which were included by Carenado. All items for the normal operating procedure checklists are available. I intend to add the short field takeoff, maximum performance climb and emergency procedures at a later date.

## Installation
To install, you need only download the inner "Cessna-182T folder" and copy it to your community folder.

For the Microsoft Store edition AND/OR Gamepass edition:

Copy the inner "Cessna-182T" folder into your community package folder. It is located in: C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community.

## Known Issues
- Some checklist items do not currently support automatic validation and automatic action. I intend to address these whereever possible in the future.
- The normal take off checklist advises setting the mixture to a 24 GPH fuel flow, however the Carenado fuel flow gauge does not allow for fuel flow that high.
